## Context

Elf’intration is the graduation game we developed as a team of eight at Haute École Albert Jacquard. I contributed to the project in multiple areas, combining animation, sound design, and multimedia production.

## 3D Animation

I worked on animating the main character alongside two colleagues, using Autodesk Maya for rigging and animation. I collaborated closely with our gameplay programmer to integrate the animations smoothly into Unity.

## Sound Design & Music

I created all the game’s sound effects in Reaper and handled integration in Unity. The soundtrack and musical elements were composed using Ableton, helping to enhance the playful and stealthy atmosphere of the game.

## Game Trailer

I also directed and produced the game trailer, showcasing the gameplay and highlighting the team’s creative vision.

Overall, this project allowed me to combine technical skills, artistic expression, and collaborative game design in a polished, playable experience.
